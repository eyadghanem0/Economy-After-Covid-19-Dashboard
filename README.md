## About The Project

This report addresses the changes in economy after the covid-19 pandemic.
Key eonomic indicators were used to create a comparative and interactive 
dashboard. Also, each country's currency was compared to USD from 2020 
to 2023. Here's a brief explanation of economic terms included in the
dashboard:

economy, indicating consumers' optimism or pessimism about their financial
situation and the overall state of the economy.

percentage change in the average price level of a basket of consumer goods 
and services over the previous year.
- Core CPI : Core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which excludes volatile items
such as food and energy prices, providing a measure of underlying inflation

## About The Work

Power BI was used to create visuals and design the dashboard, while the
icons were downloaded separately then inserted as images. The work was
completed in 2 days. The Power BI file (.pbix) is recommended to experience
the full interactivity of the report, and a pdf file is added as another option.
